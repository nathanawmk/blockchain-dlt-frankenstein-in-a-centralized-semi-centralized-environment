# blockchain-dlt-frankenstein-in-a-centralized-semi-centralized-environment
This paper puts forth the idea of a blockchain/distributed ledger technologies (DLT) as a "frankenstein" when applied in a centralized/semi-centralized environment. If blockchain/dlt does not disintermediate any entity, a frankstein is created instead. 

There are many attempts by financial intermediaries to experiment blockchain/distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in a centralized environment (e.g., financial market infrastructure). These experiments are doomed to fail for the following 3 reasons:

1. Without actual disintermediation, the blockchain/dlt solution is forced to integrate with existing systems which result in additional complexity with single point of failures without any tangible benefits. 

2. Since trust is the foremost reason why blockchain/dlt is invented in the first place, having a trusted institution plus blockchain is counter to the very essence of blockchain. It should be either-or and not both. 

3. Having a patch work of centralized and decentralized solution is not only a source of complexity but also a source of governance issue. With governance now partly ecentralized, no one knows for sure who is in charge of a certain issue. This makes troubleshooting and arbitration a real headache.   

Thus, with these 3 reasons, a blockchain/dlt solution in a centralized/semi-centralized environment is doomed to become a frankenstein.

However, not all is doom and gloom. 

A blockchain/dlt solution works best when it is ground up. i.e., a fresh slate, that is. E.g., setting up a completely new supply chain. The different cloud providers (AWS, Azure and GCP) blockchain initiatives are a first step in the right direction. It enables as-is and to-be participants to setup nodes to be part of this ground-up supply chain solution. Participants can be involved in this new network quickly with or without integration with their existing systems and most importantly, without requiring to integrate with the existing intermediaries. 

More to come.
