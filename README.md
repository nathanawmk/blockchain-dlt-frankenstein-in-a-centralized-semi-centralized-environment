# blockchain-dlt-frankenstein-in-a-centralized-semi-centralized-environment
This paper puts forth the idea of a blockchain/distributed ledger technologies (DLT) "frankenstein" when applied in a centralized/semi-centralized environment. If blockchain/dlt does not disintermediate any entity, a frankstein is created in the environment instead. 

Frankenstein: something that destroys or harms the person or people who created it.

There are many attempts by financial intermediaries to experiment blockchain/distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in a centralized environment (e.g., financial market infrastructure). These experiments are doomed to fail for the following 3 reasons:

1. Without actual disintermediation, the blockchain/dlt solution is forced to integrate with existing systems which result in additional complexity with multiple single point of failures without any tangible benefits. A DLT/Blockchain solution will be forced to integrate with Active Directories, Public Key Infrastructures (PKI), Middleware Messaging Systems, and/or multiple source systems -- e.g., proprietary trading systems, etc. What is the outcome then? A patchwork of systems which neither improves resiliency nor create transparency. What it does create is complexity and systemic risks.   

2. Since trust is the foremost reason why blockchain/dlt is invented, having a trusted institution plus blockchain is counter to the very essence of blockchain. It is either a blockchain or a trusted institution, never quite both. 

3. Having a patch work of centralized and decentralized solution is not only a source of complexity but also creates a source of governance issue. With governance now partly ecentralized, no one knows for sure who is in charge of a certain issue. This makes troubleshooting and arbitration a real headache.   

Thus, with these 3 reasons, a blockchain/dlt solution in a centralized/semi-centralized environment is doomed to become a frankenstein.

However, not all is doom and gloom. 

A blockchain/dlt solution works best when it is ground up. i.e., on a fresh sheet of paper, that is. E.g., setting up a completely new supply chain which allows many multiple participants to leave and join. The different cloud providers (AWS, Azure and GCP) blockchain initiatives are a first step in the right direction. It enables participants to setup nodes to be part of this ground-up supply chain solution. Participants can be involved in this new network quickly with or without integration with their existing legacy systems and most importantly, without requiring to integrate with the existing intermediaries such as banks, ports, etc. The banks and ports will integrate directly to these cloud platforms instead creating a seamless supply chain without a single point of failure.  

More to come.
