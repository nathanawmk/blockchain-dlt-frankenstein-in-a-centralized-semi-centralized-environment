Dear Sir/Madam,

I am a blockchain engineer from Singapore working at a leading bank in South East Asia on cutting edge research and design for blocchain/distributed ledger technologies (DLT). 

I wish to contribute ideas and share best practices so as to advance the blockchain/DLT landscape. 

Some of my thoughts/contribution can be found below. 

I am really, really looking forward to contributing to this community to help advance blockchain technologies and make a decentralized infrastructure a reality for the future generations and hopefully us. 

Please let me know how I can contribute. I can be reached at nathan.mk.aw@gmail.com
